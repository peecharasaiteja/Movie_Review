# **Introduction to the Movie Review Application**

I have developed a comprehensive movie review application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for discovering and reviewing movies. The application includes several core functionalities aimed at enhancing user interaction and data management.

## **Key Features**

### **Show All Movies**
Users can browse through a list of all available movies in the database. This feature provides a complete overview of the movie collection, including basic details such as titles, genres, and release dates.

### **Show Movie Details by ID**
By selecting a specific movie, users can view detailed information about the movie. This includes an in-depth description, cast, director, and other pertinent details. Each movie can be uniquely identified using its ID, allowing for precise data retrieval.

### **Add Review to a Particular Movie**
Users can contribute to the app by adding their own reviews to movies. This feature allows for personalized feedback and ratings, helping other users to make informed decisions about which movies to watch.

## **Technologies Used**

- **IDE:** IntelliJ
  - IntelliJ is used as the integrated development environment, providing a robust and efficient platform for coding, debugging, and testing the application.

- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
  - MongoDB Atlas serves as the database for the application. This NoSQL database is used for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration with Java applications. It ensures efficient storage and retrieval of movie data and user reviews.

- **Language:** Java 17
  - The application is developed using Java 17, taking advantage of the latest features and improvements in the language to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.

- **Project Management:** Maven
  - Maven is used as the project management and comprehension tool, facilitating the build process, dependency management, and overall project configuration.

## **Testing**

- **Postman:**
  - Postman is utilized for testing the application's endpoints. It provides a user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests and verifying the responses, ensuring that all functionalities perform as expected.

This movie review application represents a blend of modern technologies and user-centric features, aimed at providing a reliable and enjoyable platform for movie enthusiasts. The use of IntelliJ, MongoDB Atlas, Java 17, and Maven ensures a robust and maintainable codebase, while Postman aids in rigorous testing to deliver a high-quality product.
